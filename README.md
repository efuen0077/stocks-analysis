This is my work from week 2 of the Data Analysis Boot Camp.

### Creating a Message
Practice run on uploading excel files.

### Finding Total Volume and Returns
I found the total daily volume and returns in 2018 stock data.

### All Stocks Analysis
In the following attachment, I have created a Button. for the user (whom of which is being presented the data) to use to make any final decisions about which stocks to choose.

Also, the code in this file allows for one to choose what year they want to run the analysis for.

### Analysis
#### 2017

#### 2018

In order to refactor the code given for this challenge, I used a series of nested loops within the main loop "tickerIndex". Before using these loops, I created 4 arrays (tickers, volume, startingPrices, endingPrices). Each of these served as containers that would keep values stored in them. This code works for any number of stocks.

Now, as we can clearly see from the images above, stock returns in 2017 indicated that losses(magenta) in profit were a lot more significant than the losses in 2018. In the year 2018, more returns were positive(green), which indicated that there there was a profit on most of the stocks.

We can also see than ENPH and RUN stocks were in the positive (green) spectrum and made profit in both instances (2017 and 2018). Thus, it is safe to say that if one were to invest in a stock, ENPH and RUN would be the SAFEST bet!
